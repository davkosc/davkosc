# David Kosciulek

I am a Senior Engagement Officer on CDP's Forests team, supporting ambitious corporate disclosure on deforestation-related risks, opportunities, and impacts. My work experience includes analyzing disclosure data with Python, Excel, and Power BI, developing maps and curriculum for education-based non-profits, and engaging with international companies, NGO's, and CSO's on sustainability issues.

My current learning and research interests include remote sensing of deforestation and land conversion, commodity supply chain data analysis and trceability, and statistical applications of Python and R to managing sustainability impacts in organizations.
